# 1D-peloton

This repository is used for developing 1D peloton code
The 1D peloton code is used do quick analysis for pellet ablation in tokamaks.

## People:

Chao Zhang   
James Corbett

## Algorithm:
Now only using lax-wendroff scheme.
Other schemes maybe added in the future.

## Usage:

## Current Work:
We are currently working on the following jobs:   
**1. Code Structure: Chao**    
Finished the basic code structure (with content empty):
lp_main
initializer
particle_data
lp_solver
particle_viewer
pellet_solver
state_pellet
geometry_pellet
boundary_pellet

## Future Work:
