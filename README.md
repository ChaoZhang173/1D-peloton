# 1D-peloton

This repository is used for developing 1D peloton code.  
The 1D peloton code is used do quick analysis for pellet ablation in tokamaks.

## Author:

Chao Zhang   
James Corbett

## Algorithm:
Now only using lax-wendroff scheme.  
Other schemes maybe added in the future.

## Data Structure: 
STL List.  
Consider testing speed/memory using vector.

## Usage:

## Current Work:
We are currently working on the following jobs:  

**1. Code Structure: Chao**    
Finished the basic code structure (with content empty):
1. lp_main  
2. initializer  
3. particle_data   
4. lp_solver   
5. particle_viewer  
6. pellet_solver  
7. state_pellet  
8. geometry_pellet  
9. boundary_pellet
10. eos

**2. Particle data structure: James**

**3. Boundary Conditions: James**

**4. Eos and laxwendroff solver: Chao**
